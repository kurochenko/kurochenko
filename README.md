# Andrej Kurochenko

Senior developer & wannabe builder.

## Projects

[**cookt.io**](https://cookt.io) — Recipe organizer with AI. Paste any recipe format, get structured ingredients, steps, and chat with your recipes.

[**skillbook.dev**](https://skillbook.dev) — CLI tool for managing AI skills across projects and teams. Centralized library that works with any AI harness (OpenCode, Cursor, Claude Code).

## What I Do

Help teams integrate AI into their development workflow:
- Automating bug fixing and code review pipelines  
- Streamlining development processes
- Building tools that let developers focus on what matters

## Case Studies

### Production Incident Response: From Hours to Minutes

**Problem:** Production incidents required manual investigation across multiple systems — checking logs in CloudWatch, querying ALB logs in Athena, reviewing exceptions in Sentry, finding relevant code, and figuring out fixes. This took hours of senior engineer time.

**Solution:** Built AI agents that connect monitoring tools (CloudWatch, Sentry) to code repositories (GitLab). When an alert fires, the AI automatically pulls relevant logs, identifies the root cause, and creates a merge request with a proposed fix.

**Result:** What used to take hours of manual investigation now takes 5 minutes. Engineers review the AI-generated MR instead of hunting for the problem.

### Code Review Automation

AI pipeline that analyzes PRs, suggests fixes, and auto-generates merge requests for common issues.

## Background

Started with backend (JVM, Node), moved through frontend web (React) and mobile (React Native), then cloud/serverless, Linux, and DevOps.

**Lately:** TypeScript for everything — backend, frontend, terminal UIs.

**Current AI stack:** OpenCode && OpenClawd 🦞

**Passion:** Business and product development. Building things that people actually use.
