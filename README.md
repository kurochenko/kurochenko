## Tech Journey

Started with backend (JVM, Node), moved through frontend web (React) and mobile (React Native), then cloud/serverless, Linux, and DevOps.

**Lately:** TypeScript + n8n for everything — backend, frontend, terminal UIs. If it can be automated, it will be.

**Current AI stack:** OpenClawd, Claude Code, Codex, Kimi
